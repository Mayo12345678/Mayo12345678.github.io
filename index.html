        <div class="textsizing">Everyday we encounter and interact with many forces. Understanding the forces that act
          on us and the objects around us
          will give us a better sense of how the world works and how things move. Forces are applied in a particular
          direction, and they have different
          sizes which determines how much force is acting on an object. The unit which we measure force are
          <b>Newtons</b>, and their symbol is '<b>N</b>.'
          This unit is named after Sir Isaac Newton who was a scientist who came up with three laws of motion which
          describe forces.

        <h3>Force Problems </h3>
        <div class="textsizing">
          In the Mechanics exam, it is likely to you will get problems asking you to draw free body diagrams of certain
          objects and what forces are acting
          on them. The key things to remember are
          <li>that you use a ruler to draw arrows of the magnitude of force</li>
          <li>always start the arrows from the center of the object</li>
          <li>always draw the arrows size in proportion to the magnitude i.e. a 5000N arrow would be larger then a 3000N
            arrow</li>

        <h3>SLOs</h3>
        <div class="textsizing">
          The key things to revise are listed below (all of these are covered in this website)
          <li>Drawing accurate free body diagrams</li>
          <li>Balanced and Unbalanced Forces, determining if objects are accelerating or decelerating, why they are doing
            so</li>
          <li>How constant speed, acceleration, deceleration link to forces on the object in motion</li>
          <li>Definitions of force, mass, acceleration etc.</li>
          <li>Calculating and rearranging formulae needed (F = m*a & P = F/A)</li>
